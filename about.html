        <h1>Sahil Thakur</h1>
        <p>I am a passionate game developer with a strong background in C# and Unity.</p>
        <p>My journey into programming started with .NET C# and microservices, but my true interest lies in game development. Growing up, I spent a lot of time playing games like *CS:GO*, which sparked my desire to create my own games.</p>
        <p>When I joined Lovely Professional University (LPU), I had the opportunity to explore game development more seriously. The university provided me with a full course on Unity, which helped me understand the core concepts of game development, including creating Game Design Documents (GDD) and working on both 2D and 3D games.</p>
        <p>Through my studies and personal projects, I've developed several games such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fippy Bird</strong>: A 2D arcade game inspired by *Flappy Bird*.</li>
            <li><strong>2D Platformer</strong>: A side-scrolling platformer focusing on physics and level design.</li>
            <li><strong>2D Ninja Hathodi</strong>: A fast-paced action game with smooth animations and challenging gameplay.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These projects have helped me build a strong understanding of game mechanics, design, and optimization. I continue to learn and improve my skills to create more engaging and immersive experiences.</p>
        <p>In this portfolio, you will find the projects I've worked on and am currently developing. Feel free to check out my GitHub profile where you can follow these projects and contribute if you like: <a class="link-texto" href="https://github.com/sahilthakur" target="_blank">My GitHub Profile</a>.</p>
        <p>I'm always excited to work on new game development challenges, and I look forward to sharing more of my work with the community in the future!</p>
